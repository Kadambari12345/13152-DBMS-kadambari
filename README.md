The Insurance Policy and Claim Management Database System is designed to store and manage information about customers, insurance policies, agents, premium payments, and claims. Using ER (Entity-Relationship) modeling, the system identifies key entities like Customer, Policy, Claim, Agent, and their relationships. It helps track who bought which policy, made what payments, and raised which claims. This system makes insurance data organized, easy to access, and simplifies tasks like claim processing and policy tracking.
